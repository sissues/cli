## Getting Started with Your API Project

Welcome to our API exercise platform! We're excited to have you here and ready to guide you through getting started with your project. This guide will help you understand the platform, set up your project, and work towards a working solution. Don't worry—you're in good hands!

### Step 1: Understanding the Platform

Our platform is designed to help you build API projects through a series of exercises. Each exercise will simulate real-world scenarios, helping you develop practical skills. Here’s what you need to know:

- **Exercises**: These are mini-projects with multiple steps. Each step is designed to build on the previous one, gradually increasing in complexity.
- **Automatic Test Suites**: Each exercise comes with a set of automated tests. These tests will check your code and ensure it meets the requirements.
- **Manual Code Reviews**: For a fee, you can get your code reviewed manually. This is optional but can provide valuable feedback.

### Step 2: Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start coding, you need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. Refer to the [Getting started with docker guide](https://github.com/sissues/cli/blob/main/docs/getting_start_with_docker.md) to learn how to install Docker, and tweak the dockerfile template to your programming language and API framework.

### Step 3: Starting Your Project

1. **Pick an Exercise**: Browse the available exercises. Choose one that interests you and click on it to view the details.
2. **Initialize the Project**: Click the "Start Project" button. This will initialize the project template for you, setting up everything you need to get started.
3. **Review the Dockerfile Template**: The initialized project will include a Dockerfile template. For guidance on how to modify it, refer to our [Getting started with docker guide](https://github.com/sissues/cli/blob/main/docs/getting_start_with_docker.md).

### Step 4: Writing Your Code

With your project set up, you can start writing your code. Here are some tips to help you get started:

1. **Follow the Instructions**: Each exercise comes with detailed instructions. Follow them carefully to ensure you meet the requirements.
2. **Test Frequently**: Use the "Run Tests" button to run the provided tests frequently. This will help you catch issues early and ensure your code meets the requirements.
3. **Ask for Help**: If you get stuck, don't hesitate to ask questions by [opening an issue](https://github.com/sissues/cli/issues). We're here to help!

### Step 5: Running Tests

Running tests is crucial to ensure your code works as expected. Here’s how you can run the tests on our platform:

1. **Click "Run Tests"**: Once you’ve written some code, and modified your Dockerfile correctly, click the "Run Tests" button. The platform will automatically build your Docker image and run the tests for you.
2. **Check the Results**: Review the test results and fix any issues. Repeat this process until all tests pass.

### Final Tips

- **Stay Positive**: Learning new skills can be challenging, but stay positive and persistent. You can do this!
- **Practice Makes Perfect**: The more you practice, the better you'll become. Keep working on the exercises and refining your skills.
- **Use Resources**: Make use of the resources available to you, including documentation, forums, and community support.

Remember, you're not alone on this journey. We're here to support you every step of the way. Happy coding!
